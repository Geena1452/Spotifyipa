# SpotilifeC
This is my repo for compiled Spotilife IPA's.

I post a new realease every week unless I'm busy, or their are no updates for Spotilife nor Spotify. I get the latest Spotify IPA's from [here](https://armconverter.com/decryptedappstore/us/spotify) and then inject the Spotilife .deb from Julio's repo [here](julio.hackyouriphone.org)
