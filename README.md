# SpotilifeC
This is my repo for compiled Spotilife IPA's. Spotilife is a Spotify IOS app tweak that removes ads, removes limited skips, and almost everyother premium feature. The main premium feature that does not work is offline downloads, as this is done server-side.

I post a new realease almost every week unless I'm busy, or their are no updates for Spotilife nor Spotify. I get the latest Spotify IPA's from [here](https://armconverter.com/decryptedappstore/us/spotify) and then inject the Spotilife .deb from Julio's repo [here](julio.hackyouriphone.org) using [Sidloadly](https://sideloadly.io) I do not do anything else to the IPA (Unless otherwise spesified in the reaslease notes)... However please note that therorettically IOSGod's decryted app store could insert malware, same with sidloadly and julio's tweak. This is use at your own risk, and I  am not reasponsible for *ANY* damage.
