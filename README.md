# SpotilifeC
This is my repo for compiled Spotilife IPAs. Spotilife is a Spotify IOS app tweak that removes ads, removes limited skips, and almost every other premium feature. The main premium feature that does not work is offline downloads, as this is done server-side.

I post a new release almost every week unless I'm busy, or there are no updates for Spotilife or Spotify. I get the latest Spotify IPA's from [here](https://armconverter.com/decryptedappstore/us/spotify) Then get the latest Spotilife .deb from Julio's repo [here](julio.hackyouriphone.org) using [cydownload](https://github.com/borishonman/cydownload). I then inject the .deb into the IPA using [Sidloadly](https://sideloadly.io) I do not do anything else to the IPA (Unless otherwise specified in the release notes)... However please note that theoretically, IOSGod's decrypted app store could insert malware, same with Sideloadly, cydownload and julio's tweak. This is use at your own risk, and I am not responsible for *ANY* damage.

Version Format is *SpotilifeC Version*-*Julio's Tweaks Version*-*Spotify Version*<br/>
Ex. *v1.3.6*-*v1.2_Beta2*-*v8.7.78*
