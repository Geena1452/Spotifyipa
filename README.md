# SpotilifeC<br/>
This is my repo for compiled Spotilife IPAs. Spotilife is a Spotify IOS app tweak that removes ads, removes limited skips, and almost every other premium feature. The only main premium feature that does not work is offline downloads, as this is done server-side.

## Adding to AltStore<br/>
You can add my repo to AltStore *Beta* for automatic updates and conviniance, by following the steps below:<br/>
1. Tap "Sources" in the top-right corner of the Browse tab.<br/>
2. Tap the ”+” button and add my source by entering its URL "https://tiny.one/spotcompiled"
3. Now SpotilifeC and any other "SpotC" Apps I realease will show up in AltStore under the "Browse" tab where you can install and update my apps easily from within AltStore.<br/>

## How it's Made<br/>
I post a new release everytime their is an Spotilife Update, or there is a new major Spotify update that is compatible with the latest Spotilife. I get the Spotify IPA from IOS God's [Decrypted AppStore](https://armconverter.com/decryptedappstore/us/spotify) Then I download the latest Spotilife .deb from Julio's repo [here](https://julio.hackyouriphone.org) using [cydownload](https://github.com/borishonman/cydownload). I then inject the .deb into the IPA using [Sidloadly](https://sideloadly.io) I do not do anything else to the IPA (Unless otherwise specified in the release notes)... However please note that theoretically, IOSGod's decrypted app store could insert malware, same with Sideloadly, cydownload and julio's tweak, these are, however, either considered trusted by the community and/or Open-Source. This is use at your own risk, and I am not responsible for *ANY* damage.

Version Format is *SpotilifeC Version*-*Julio's Tweaks Version*-*Spotify Version*<br/>
Ex. *v1.3.6*-*v1.8*-*v8.7.78*<br/>
